Program 1 : Find all settings of x and y of type bool that will cause this code to print True.
x = ...
y = ...
print(not x or y)

Answer:
1.
x = True
y = True
print(not x or y) = True

2. 
x = False
y = True
print(not x or y) = True

3. 
x = False
y = False
print(not x or y) = True


Program 2: Find the smallest integer x such that the following code will print True.
x = ... 
print(x >= 42 and (x%20) // 10 == 1)

Answer:
From condition 2;
	(x%20) should be greater or equal to 10 and less than 20,
From condition 1;
	x cannot be less than 42
from comparing the above two conditions; 
	x should be greater than 50 because (x%20) will be less than 10 if the x is less than 50,
	so (50%20) // 10 == 1 and it is greater than 42
Therefore, 50 is the smallest integer that satisfice both the conditions.
