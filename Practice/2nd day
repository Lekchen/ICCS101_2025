Write a function gravity(board: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]] 
that moves all the 1’s downwards so they are stacked at the bottom of the board. 
This is like like applying gravity to the board and all the 1’s are pulled down. 
Your gravity function should return a new board representing the input board after applying the gravity.
