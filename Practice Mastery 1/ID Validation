Task 3
Every citizen of Condaland has a 15-digit identification number, for example,
123045607890126. However, not every 15-digit number is a valid identification number. 
In this problem, you are to write a function valid_id(idnum: str) -> bool 
that takes a string idnum and returns a Boolean indicating whether the given string is a valid identification number according the rules laid out below.
To validate a 15-digit number, use the following steps:
Multiply each digit by its digit position. The digit position of a digit is how far it is from the right end. The rightmost digit has digit position 1, the 2nd rightmost digit has digit position 2, and so on.
Add up the products (digit * digit position) of all the digits _except_ for the rightmost digit. Call this sum c
Let a = (11 - c%11)%10. The 15-digit number is valid if the rightmost digit is the same as a.

Answer:
def valid_id(idnum: str) -> bool:
    position = 15
    total = -int(idnum[-1])
    for i in range(len(idnum)):
        digit = int(idnum[i])
        total += digit * (position - i)
    return int(idnum[-1]) == (11 - total%11)%10
