Task 2
Write a function better_swap_case(st: str) -> str that takes in a string and returns the input string where each character is adjusted according to the following rules:
For vowels—that is, "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"—their case remains unchanged
For other letters of the English alphabet, their case is swapped. That is to say, every lowercase letter is turned into its corresponding uppercase letter and vice versa.
Each non-letter character is replaced by a space.
For example:
better_swap_case('aBC') == 'abc' (Notice that a remains lower case because it's a vowel.)
better_swap_case('Hello~HuMAN') == 'heLLo humAn' (Every letter has their case swapped aside from the vowels, and the non-letter character ~ is replaced by a space)
better_swap_case('PythOn1Cs-is!coOl') == 'pYTHON cS iS CoOL'
(*Hint*: If s is a string, s.isalpha() returns whether s is a letter in the English alphabet.)

Answer:
def better_swap_case(st: str) -> str:
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    st_1 = str()
    for i in st:
        if i.isalpha():
            if i not in vowels:
                st_1 += i.swapcase()
            else:
                st_1 += i
        else:
            st_1 += " "
    return st_1
